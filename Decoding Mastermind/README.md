A boards game, in which you have to guess the right combination of colors and positions.
There is a secret color code made up of 4 different colors (available colors = 6).
The guesser just guesses a possible permutation-code and the opponent gives them
hints to correct their actions in next round. Hints are colors and if a hint is:
* Red: Each red hint symbolizes that the guesser guessed a correct color and in the correct position
* White: Each white hint symbolizes that the guesser guessed a correct color, but in wrong position
* Black: Each black hint symbolizes that there is a wrong color
